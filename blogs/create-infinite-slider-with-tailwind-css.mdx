Infinite sliders are a versatile tool in web design, perfect for showcasing brand logos, testimonials,
or any sequence of content that needs to be continuously looped. They provide a dynamic,
interactive element to your site, keeping your audience engaged.

For this effect at first I wanted to used the [marquee](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/marquee) html tag, but it is deprecated and not supported in all browsers.

In this article, we'll explore how to create an elegant and responsive infinite slider using Tailwind CSS, without relying on any third-party dependencies.

<InfiniteSlider />

## Getting Started

1. The first section of the code imports various icons from the Radix UI library. These icons will be used in the slider.

```jsx
import {
  FigmaLogoIcon,
  FramerLogoIcon,
  SketchLogoIcon,
  TwitterLogoIcon,
  GitHubLogoIcon,
  VercelLogoIcon,
  NotionLogoIcon,
  DiscordLogoIcon,
  InstagramLogoIcon,
  LinkedInLogoIcon,
} from "@radix-ui/react-icons";
```

2. The LOGOS array is created which contains instances of each of these icons with a specific width, height and color.

```jsx
const LOGOS = [
  <FigmaLogoIcon width={24} height={24} className="text-slate-800" />,
  ...
];
```

3. The Slider component is created which will contain the logic for the infinite slider.

```jsx
export const InfiniteSlider = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <div className="... relative m-auto w-[500px] overflow-hidden bg-white">
        <div className="slide-track flex w-[calc(250px*10)]">...</div>
      </div>
      ...
    </>
  );
};
```

4. The outer div is styled to be a relative container with a width of 500px, an overflow of hidden to hide the parts of the slider that go beyond its width, and a background color of white. It also has before and after pseudo-elements that create a fade-in and fade-out effect on the edges of the slider. Finaly it has a custom animation called animate-infinite-slider that is defined in the `tailwind.config.ts` file.

```jsx
<div className="animate-infinite-slider relative m-auto w-[500px] overflow-hidden bg-white before:absolute before:left-0 before:top-0 before:z-[2] before:h-full before:w-[100px] before:bg-[linear-gradient(to_right,white_0%,rgba(255,255,255,0)_100%)] before:content-[''] after:absolute after:right-0 after:top-0 after:z-[2] after:h-full after:w-[100px] after:-scale-x-100 after:bg-[linear-gradient(to_right,white_0%,rgba(255,255,255,0)_100%)] after:content-['']">
  ...
</div>
```

5. Inside the slide-track div, the LOGOS array is mapped twice to create two sets of slides. This is done to create the illusion of an infinite slider. When the first set of slides finishes, the second set starts, creating a seamless transition.

```jsx
{
  LOGOS.map((logo, index) => (
    <div
      className="slide flex w-[125px] items-center justify-center"
      key={index}
    >
      {logo}
    </div>
  ));
}
{
  LOGOS.map((logo, index) => (
    <div
      className="slide flex w-[125px] items-center justify-center"
      key={index}
    >
      {logo}
    </div>
  ));
}
```

6. The `tailwind.config.ts` file is updated to include the custom animation called animate-infinite-slider. This animation is defined in the keyframes section of the file.

```ts
...
  animation: {
    ["infinite-slider"]: "infiniteSlider 20s linear infinite",
  },
  keyframes: {
    infiniteSlider: {
      "0%": { transform: "translateX(0)" },
      "100%": {
        transform: "translateX(calc(-250px * 5))",
      },
    },
  },
...

```
